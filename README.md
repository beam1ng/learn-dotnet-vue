# WoRdLE

At least it seems to only provide just that.

## TODO for now
- handle the 'guess' button - it should be enabled only when a user entered a full word


- generate the target word using the word frequency data
- retrieve the target word from the backend
- retrieve guesses from the backend
- implement difficulity feature
- move all critical data to the backend or use some cryptography stuff to make the validation local etc

## Installation
- Add Backend/appsettings.json file based on it's exisitng .template example. Update the default connection field with appropriate connection string.
- Setup a database containing all required models.
