# WoRdLE

At least it seems to only provide just that.

## TODO for now
- handle the wordle modal's open / close events 
- handle the 'guess' button - it should be enabled only when a user entered a full word
- add a reset button
- detect a win

## TODO for future
- generate the target word using the word frequency data
- retrieve the target word from the backend
- retrieve guesses from the backend
- implement difficulity feature
- move all critical data to the backend or use some cryptography stuff to make the validation local etc
